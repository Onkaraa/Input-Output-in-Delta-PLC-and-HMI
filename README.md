Simple Input and Output Timer and Control Switch in Delta PLC
Overview
This project demonstrates a simple input and output timer and control switch functionality implemented in Delta PLC and HMI software. The project is designed for educational purposes, helping users understand the use of timers, inputs, outputs, and control switches in PLC and HMI systems.

Features
Input Control: The user can provide input to control the system.
Output Control: The system uses outputs based on the input and timer logic.
Timer Functionality: Timers are implemented to introduce delays or specific timing behaviors.
Control Switch: A switch is used to toggle the system's behavior on or off.
Components
Delta PLC: The core logic and control are implemented using a Delta PLC.
HMI (Human-Machine Interface): The HMI provides the interface for interacting with the PLC system, such as input buttons and displaying output status.
Requirements
Delta PLC hardware
Delta PLC programming software (e.g., WPLSoft or ISPSoft)
HMI software for Delta PLC (e.g., DOPSoft)
Installation
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the PLC and HMI projects using the respective Delta software (WPLSoft for PLC and DOPSoft for HMI).
Upload the project files to your Delta PLC and configure the HMI interface.
Power on the system and test the input, output, and timer control functionalities.
Usage
Input Control: Press the input button on the HMI to trigger the logic.
Control Switch: Use the switch on the HMI to enable or disable the logic flow.
Timer: The timer will control the delay or wait time before activating certain outputs based on the logic programmed in the PLC.
